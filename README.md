```sh
nvm use
```

If you donâ€™t have the correct version installed, run:

```sh
nvm install 20.18.2
```

## Installation

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Running the Server
To start the development server, use:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

## Running with Docker GUI or Docker Compose
### Using Docker Compose
To run the project inside a Docker container using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   services:
     pg:
       image: bitnami/postgresql:latest
       ports:
         - "5433:5432"
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=docker
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker
         - POSTGRES_DB=upload_test
       volumes:
         - "./docker:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d"
   ```

3. Run the container with:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Stop the container with:

   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Using Docker GUI
If using Docker Desktop, follow these steps:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Click on **Containers** > **Add Container**.
3. Select **Build from Source** and point it to your project directory.
4. Configure the necessary ports (e.g., `3333:3333`).
5. Start the container.

## Environment Variables
The project uses the following environment variables:

```ini
PORT=3333
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://docker:docker@localhost:5432/upload"

# CloudFlare R2
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=""
CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
CLOUDFLARE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
CLOUDFLARE_BUCKET=""
CLOUDFLARE_PUBLIC_URL="https://pub-secret"
```

Ensure you create a `.env` file with these variables before running the project.
